# PyjectX
Automate folder creation before starting a new project. I don't actually use this simple script considering it's not hard and doesn't take long to create folders, but I made this when learning Python to help solidify some things.

## Note
Only tested on Windows 7, but the code shouldn't be platform-specific.
